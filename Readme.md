## Usage
1. Run the Program
Execute the Control.py file
```python
   python Control.py
```
2. Control Game Actions
Interact with the game using natural body movements. Upon starting the program, vertical and horizontal lines will be drawn on the screen via the webcam to facilitate gesture recognition.

- Movement Control:

    - Vertical Line Interaction: 
        - Move to the left or right of the vertical line drawn on the screen to control the character's left or right movement. Shifting your body to the left moves the character left, and shifting to the right moves the character right.


- Action Control:

    - Horizontal Line Interaction:
        - Small Jump: Raise your shoulders above the first horizontal line to trigger a small jump in the game.
        - Long Jump: Raise your shoulders above the second horizontal line to perform a long jump.
        - Move Down: Lower your head below the first horizontal line to cause the character to duck or move down.
