## Introduction

The Jungle Adventure World Automated Project enables users to control Jungle Adventure World using natural body gestures. Moving left and right mimics real-life motions, while raising the right hand above the right shoulder triggers the character to jump. Similarly, raising the left hand allows the player to throw stones. This project utilizes MediaPipe and PyDirectInput to accurately interpret these gestures, enhancing gameplay by integrating physical movements with digital interactions.
